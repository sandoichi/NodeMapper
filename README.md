# NodeMapper
Learning experiment when starting out with Elm / pure functional programming in general. 

This is a visual tool for connecting a series of nodes with single/bidirectional arrows on a scaleable canvas. The end goal was to have the ability to attach meaningful metadata to nodes and then perform various pathfinding algorithms on the overall graph.
